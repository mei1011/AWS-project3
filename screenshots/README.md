* GitHub repositoryâ€™s settings showing your Travis webhook (can be found in Settings - Webhook).

  **I used Github action instead of Travis. Because I had problems with my travis's account**

   Here are some of the main similarities between Travis CI and GitHub Actions:

  - Both tools use YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) format for their configuration files.
  - Both tools support a wide range of programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js, and more.
  - Both tools allow you to run your workflows on different operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, and macOS.
